      <p>This is the homemade brownie recipe that you haven't even realized that you've been missing out on!  Only common kitchen ingredients are used and you will be very happy with how these turn out.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: This is not my recipe.</strong> This page was made for the purpose of practicing web design.  Here is the <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/brownies-recipe/">original recipe.</a></p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar (1 cup for guilt-free option)</li>
          <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
          <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
          <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
          <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an <strong>8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook)</strong> with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
          <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
          <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). <strong>Cool completely before slicing (about 2 hours).</strong> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
        </ol>
