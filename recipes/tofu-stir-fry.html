      <h2>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Start the rice/quinoa: </strong>If serving with a grain, start it now.</li>
          <li><strong>Make the sauce: </strong>Whisk together the stir fry sauce ingredients in a medium bowl, or make the sauce in advance and refrigerate until cooking.</li>
          <li><strong>Chop the veggies: </strong>Chop the broccoli into florets. Thinly slice the pepper. Remove the shiitake stems and thinly slice them, if using. Thinly slice the green onion. Peel and grate the ginger.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook the tofu: </strong>Cut the tofu into bite sized pieces (1-inch squares, 3/8-inch thick and pat it dry with a towel. Add 2 tablespoons sesame oil to a large non-stick pan and add the tofu cubes and a few pinches of kosher salt. Turn on the heat to medium-high. Cook 5 to 6 minutes until browned. Remove the tofu to a bowl and set it aside.</li>
          <li><strong>Stir fry the veggies: </strong>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add the brocoli, pepper, and shiitake mushrooms and two pinches salt and cook 6 to 7 minutes until just starting to brown on edges, stirring occasionally. In the last minute, add 1 tablespoon water and allow the vegetables to steam.</li>
          <li>Turn down the heat to low. Add the green onion and ginger and cook 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Add the tofu and sauce and stir until the sauce thickens. Garnish with sesame seeds if desired. Serve immediately. Store leftovers up to 3 days refrigerated.</li>
